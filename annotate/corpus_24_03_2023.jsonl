Predicting protein organelle localization labels for each sample. There were in total 28 different labels present in the dataset. The dataset was acquired in a highly standardized way using one imaging modality (confocal microscopy). However, the dataset comprises 27 different cell types of highly different morphology, which affect the protein patterns of the different organelles. All image samples were represented by four filters (stored as individual files), the protein of interest (green) plus three cellular landmarks: nucleus (blue), microtubules (red), endoplasmic reticulum (yellow). Preprocessed the given data and used Convolution Neural Network to predict the class for given protein image.  Used GPU and server computing on AWS to run the code, since the data were too big and would take much time to pre-process data and fit the model.  Music Genre Classifier Used the GTZAN dataset, which is frequently used to benchmark music genre classification tasks. It was organized into 10 distinct genres: blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, and rock. The dataset contains the first 30 seconds of 100 songs per genre. The tracks were recorded at 22,050 Hz (22,050 readings per second) mono in the au format. Classified music files into 10 predetermined genres such as jazz, classical, country, pop, rock, and metal by building and testing different machine learning models. Topic Categorization Dataset was  obtained from 20Newsgroups. The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. This collection has become a popular dataset for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering. Used Bag of Words model, (writing Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression from scratch) for building Machine Learning algorithm to predict the category of the given news group. Other Projects :      \tNASA Swarm Base Code Designed and conducted experiments on Swarm Robots and Simulated code through aRGOSand ROS environment.

Personal Projects Kaggle: Human Protein Atlas Image Classification Was provided with 250 gb  (3072 x 3072 TIFF) image files from  Human protein Atlas dataset. Predicting protein organelle localization labels for each sample. There were in total 28 different labels present in the dataset. The dataset was acquired in a highly standardized way using one imaging modality (confocal microscopy). However, the dataset comprises 27 different cell types of highly different morphology, which affect the protein patterns of the different organelles. All image samples were represented by four filters (stored as individual files), the protein of interest (green) plus three cellular landmarks: nucleus (blue), microtubules (red), endoplasmic reticulum (yellow). Preprocessed the given data and used Convolution Neural Network to predict the class for given protein image.  Used GPU and server computing on AWS to run the code, since the data were too big and would take much time to pre-process data and fit the model.  Music Genre Classifier Used the GTZAN dataset, which is frequently used to benchmark music genre classification tasks. It was organized into 10 distinct genres: blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, and rock. The dataset contains the first 30 seconds of 100 songs per genre. The tracks were recorded at 22,050 Hz (22,050 readings per second) mono in the au format. Classified music files into 10 predetermined genres such as jazz, classical, country, pop, rock, and metal by building and testing different machine learning models. Topic Categorization Dataset was  obtained from 20Newsgroups. The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. This collection has become a popular dataset for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering. Used Bag of Words model for building Machine Learning algorithm to predict the category of the given news group.
