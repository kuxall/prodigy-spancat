It is an ensemble online application taking care of enrollment, fulfilment, letter writing, agents etc. COMPAS also communicates with various systems. Some of these are AVAYA and OPTUM. I have been involved as a Scrum master for 3 teams with the following projects, spanning one product: Avaya: With AVAYA, COMPAS receives a bulk of users registered during the Annual Enrollment period (AEP). COMPAS then sends an outbound file to AVAYA - which makes automated calls to those users. Upon validation, AVAYA sends a disposition file back to COMPAS and it is processed and stored there. OPTUM: With OPTUM, it is a multi-factor authentication (MF) project. COMPAS already had SiteMinder for authentication purposes, but decided to add a more secure authentication system through OPTUM. The Employer web and Provider web users register first and are then added to the Work Queue. Every time a login attempt is made through EWEB/PWEB, OPTUM takes over and validates with the information in its database and also provides yet another layer of authentication with an access code to be entered (sent to registered phone number/ email ID).  COMPAS-Portfolio: COMPAS in itself needed work in the form of upgrades. It was using Java 1.7 and we were upgrading it to 1.8.

TECHNICAL PROFICIENCIES: WORK EXPERIENCE Paypal, San Jose, CA\t\t\t\tSeptember 2014 \u2013 Present Backend Java Developer\t Description: PayPal is an international e-commerce business allowing payments and money transfers to be made through the Internet. Onboarding Platform exposes RESTful APIs through which Front Tier components, Batches, API callers, Partners, Developers, Mobile apps etc. can onboard customers. It is a coarse grained API to be able to serve different kinds of use-cases and customer onboardings via a single interface. The actual contract is in the HTTP message whose schema and format varies depending on the type of use-cases. The Onboarding platform imposes very little or no restrictions on its clients in terms of how they interact with the platform. Clients can be very chatty with the platform and send data incrementally to the platform or if they choose, call the platform at the end as if they were making an API call. The platform supports both interaction models and all the others in between.When a new customer comes to Paypal and expresses an intent on what they want to use Paypal for, it initiates an onboarding flow. Based on the customer intent, it creates an account or no. Behind the scenes, onboarding platform is an orchestration engine. It coordinates with various core and peer mid tier services. The coordination is expressed as a workflow which is defined based on the intents the customer started with. Customer\u2019s data is persisted in respective domains.

Due to frequent build-book changes and lack of real-time data exchange leads to non-optimal scheduling and this causes roadblocks in meeting the goal of 240 in-house barrier crash tests. The current scheduling tool is semi-automated. Inputs required for scheduling are gathered manually and is not available real time in the scheduling tool. The existing scheduling tool does not have auto-manpower assignment and auto-calculated scheduling parameters. There are too many face-to-face interactions to exchange data (schedule, resource availability, build book updates, pre-build meeting invites, notification for build-book due date) between stakeholders. Due to frequent build book changes and reschedules, the target of 5 crashes a week is not met. Currently the number of crashes conducted in a week is 3-4 and remaining crashes are outsourced. Outsourcing of barrier crash tests results in increased costs.       This specification outlines requirements for a Fully automated real-time scheduling tool to provide real-time resource availability data as much as possible during scheduling.
