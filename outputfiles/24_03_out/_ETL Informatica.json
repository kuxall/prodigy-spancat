If any new customer comes adding to the warehouse or existing customer information will be updated from the daily extraction. Responsibilities: Involved in identifying all the Data Models for all the applications. Effectively worked on Healthcare Data Repository. Involved in creating reusable control table driven ETL Architecture. Created Technical Specifications document based on functional specifications. Developed complex ETL mappings that involve parallel processing of multiple instances basing on certain parameters in control table. Created complex Mappings using different Transformations like Filter, Router, Joiner, Connected & Unconnected Lookups, Sorter, Aggregator and Sequence Generator to pipeline data to Data Warehouse. Extracted data from heterogeneous sources like flat files, Oracle, db2 and loading the same into oracle and flat files. Implemented various match and merge rules based on the requirement to generate master data. Created post-sessions and pre-sessions for all the sessions to update the etl_process table which is used to understand the current status of ETLs. Involved in performance tuning on Informatica ETL mappings analyzing them thoroughly. Involved in identifying various bottle necks at different levels (database, mapping, session, and workflow) and came up with solution to improve the performance. Created table partitions for each of the country, operating company and period combination which enables faster retrieval of data. Created Oracle Stored Procedures to implement the ETL Process control logic. Designed Oracle views that generate these extracts for upstream applications and created ETLs to read these views and drop them in a file. Created a model for Audit mechanism and included the Audit counts in each of the ETLs to verify the source and target counts and sums. Identified various extracts needed for upstream reporting applications and planning applications and designed structures for the same. Documented all the ETL and Oracle Procedures developed. Created Unit Test plans for various ETLs developed. Performed Unit Testing and Integration testing for the ETL\u2019s. Reviewed the Code, Design and Test plans as appropriated throughout project lifecycle.
