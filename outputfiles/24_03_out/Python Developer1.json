It is build using Python, image processing and video processing Scraping of Real Estate Property Data from the Web: This project scrapes property data from a real estate websites, yellow pages or information from Wikipedia using web scrapping using Python. It gets the data and store them in a table i.e. Pandas data frame. To do web scrubbing on this real estate website with Python, it performs a search query on a certain location so Python will search for data and then it gets that data, and stores it in the table, and then finally in an output CSV file, so everything is automatic Desktop Application to store information of Books: Developed a desktop graphical program with a database backend program that allows the user to store information about books. Program is an executable file that run on windows and dot app files that run on Mac. It is built mainly with Tkinter which a graphical user interface library and the SQLite3 library which is a library to interact with SQLite database Interactive Dictionary using Python: Created an interactive dictionary which takes Json data file and extracts definition of word along with identification of case sensitivity, suggesting similarity of two words if there is spelling error, recommending best match and user confirmation Sr. System Analyst, Techrel Technologies, Pune, Maharashtra, India\t\t\t\t                             February 2013 \u2013 June 2016 Project: To identify the language of the file it is written in when file extensions are not written properly, or file extensions are missing for a client moving existing data to Aws cloud to be stored in formatted manner to gather static metrics for Java, JavaScript, & config files Challenge: To identify language of the file when developer uses a non-standard extension such as name of component it relates to or doesn\u2019t add file extension at all to know which parser should be used to gather the static metrics. Data Scrapping: Created Pandas dataframes by reading file lists into data frames then sampled them using reproducible seed by using library as random, os for os_walk, pattern matching using fnmatch Predictive model using Machine learning algorithm: Created a prediction target and explored to target data using sklearn. Used number tokenization method to isolate numbers from words and symbols using nltk. Identified frequency of most common words in file using frequency distribution function in nltk. Visualized the top 30 characters appeared in tokenized frequency using Seaborn library of python. The tokenizing of texts and building a bi-directional LSTM (Deep learning model), with single- class prediction helped in predicting probability if the code is of particular language or not. Training the model: Initialized the vectorizer and created sparse feature matrix to transform words into numerical tokens to be used for modelling using Tfidfvectorizer. Trained Na\u00efve Bayes model on training data where input to the model was vectorized data and output was probability if the file was of particular language or not.  Visualizing the model performance: Created a confusion matrix to identify test predictions to check the accuracy by finding true positives and false negatives. Visualized final out put using histogram to check whether the prediction is correct or not. Confusion matrix visualization helped in demonstrating how well the model performed Libraries used: OS, Fnmatch, random, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, numpy, nltk, seaborn, urllib Languages extracted: Java, C, C#, Python IDEs used: Pycharm, Jupyter, Anaconda, Atom Project 2: Fraud detection of Credit transactions and identification of customer satisfaction  Prediction Model: Designed and developed a prediction models for new areas to be explored for new customer segment and optimizing market behaviors while introducing new banking products in the target market using linear regression algorithm for behavior analysis and logistic regression for new product introduction to check satisfaction reports and check fraudulent transactions using classification algorithm of machine learning Data structure analysis: Analyzed the existing data, created new data structures to identify transactional records to examine customer trends which further helped in predicting customer satisfaction rate using Tensorlflow Sales and Marketing Analysis using Python: Worked with sales and Marketing team for collaborating with cross functional team to frame and answer important questions using data analysis with the help of Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries in Python Data Model Design and Integration: Designed a data model for a multi-vendor product environment of \u2018Gramin\u2019/ Rural Banking sector, being used for systems integration, operational data storage, reports, and data migration Business Analysis: Ensured 100% alignment of deliverables with business requirements of \u2018ATM Switching\u2019 software, solution design and integration design by collaborating with vendors and technical delivery team Technologies: Java, Oracle SQL, DB2, Python, Excel, NLP, AWS, Powershell Python and machine learning libraries: OS, PySpark, Tensorflow, VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE\t PRESIDENT, ENACTUS, The University of Texas at Dallas,\t                    January 2017- May 2018 Award Winning Leadership: Secured 5 awards from Enactus and the University including fellowship from Bank of New York, Student Leader of the Year award and Diamond Service leadership for serving more than 1500 hours    Establishment and Reformation of Organization: Developed a new organizational structure from zero to 100 members for UT Dallas and helped in increasing team productivity by 12 times by starting 5 CSR projects in one year.
