Due to frequent build-book changes and lack of real-time data exchange leads to non-optimal scheduling and this causes roadblocks in meeting the goal of 240 in-house barrier crash tests. The current scheduling tool is semi-automated. Inputs required for scheduling are gathered manually and is not available real time in the scheduling tool. The existing scheduling tool does not have auto-manpower assignment and auto-calculated scheduling parameters. There are too many face-to-face interactions to exchange data (schedule, resource availability, build book updates, pre-build meeting invites, notification for build-book due date) between stakeholders. Due to frequent build book changes and reschedules, the target of 5 crashes a week is not met. Currently the number of crashes conducted in a week is 3-4 and remaining crashes are outsourced. Outsourcing of barrier crash tests results in increased costs.       This specification outlines requirements for a Fully automated real-time scheduling tool to provide real-time resource availability data as much as possible during scheduling.
